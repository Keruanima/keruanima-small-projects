This repository is the vault of my small personal projects that I do for fun and to prove to myself and others that even though I'm mainly a designer, I can still find solutions for what I want to do. I want to be completely honest with you: I do use AI to develop these projects, although I try to learn from the process, and it serves as a good exercise to think in a more logical and structured way.

Of course, you are free to "steal" my code; there's no problem with that. But if you're just going to copy it as it is and show it to others, making it look like yours, please refrain from doing so. Instead, give me credit or modify it. Thanks for checking out my work! :)

Also, if you need someone for a creative job, design an interface or do some video or graphic design stuff maybe you'll like to contact me: info@keruanima.com
