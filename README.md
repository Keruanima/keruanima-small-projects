This repository is the vault of my small personal projects I do for fun and to prove myself and others that even being mainly a designer I still can find solutions for what I want to do. 
I want to be completelly hontest with you, I do use AI to make this developments, although I try to learn from the process and it is a good exercise to be able to think in a more logical and structured way.

Of course you are free to "steal" my code, no problem with it, but if you are just going to copy it as it is and show to others making it look like yours, please don't do it, and give me credit or modify it.
Thanks for checking my work! :) 

Also, if you need someone for a creative job, design an interface or do some video or graphic design stuff maybe you'll like to contact me: info@keruanima.com
